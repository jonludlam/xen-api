xen-api for Debian
------------------

This is the XCP toolstack ported to Debian. Installing these packages will turn
a Debian system into an XCP virtualization host. While we aim to be
functionally equivalent to a standard XCP system, not all features are
currently ported to Debian. Noteably, block-based storage repositories have
been disabled.
