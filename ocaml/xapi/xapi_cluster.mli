(******************************************************************************)
(** {2 External API calls} *)

val create : __context:Context.t -> network:API.ref_network ->
  cluster_stack:string -> pool_auto_join:bool -> API.ref_Cluster
(** [create ~__context ~network ~cluster_stack ~pool_auto_join] is the
    implementation of the XenAPI method 'Cluster.create'. It is the constructor
    of the Cluster object. *)

val destroy : __context:Context.t -> self:API.ref_Cluster -> unit
(** [destroy ~__context ~self] is the implementation of the XenAPI method
    'Cluster.destroy'. It is the destructor of the Cluster object *)

val pool_create : __context:Context.t -> pool:API.ref_pool ->
  cluster_stack:string -> network:API.ref_network -> API.ref_Cluster
(** [pool_create ~__context ~pool ~cluster_stack ~network] is the implementation
    of the XenAPI method 'Cluster.pool_create'. This is a convenience function
    that creates the Cluster object and then creates Cluster_host objects for
    all hosts in the pool. *)

val pool_resync : __context:Context.t -> cluster:API.ref_Cluster -> unit
(** [pool_resync ~__context ~self] is the implementation of the XenAPI
    method 'Cluster.pool_resync'. The purpose of this function is to help
    after the failure to create Cluster_host objects. It should create all
    necessary Cluster_host objects (ie., one for each host in the pool
    if the Cluster has [pool_auto_join] set. If there is a failure, this
    function must return an error that enables the administrator to fix
    the problem. *)
